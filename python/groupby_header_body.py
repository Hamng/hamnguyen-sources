Problem:
Hi all, I have a command line tool that outputs a multi-line string
and Iâ€™d like to parse it into a dict. Anyone have a nice way of doing so?
Input to parse:
Node: HomePod (2).local.
    Interface: en0
    Interface: awdl0
Node: HomePod.local.
    Interface: en0
    Interface: anpi0
    Interface: awdl0
    Interface: lo0
Output:
[{"node": "HomePod (2).local.", "Interfaces": ["en0", "awdl0"]},
 {"node": "HomePod.local.", "Interfaces": ["en0", "anpi0", "awdl0", "lo0"]}]

from typing import List, Dict
import itertools

#
# 1. Before grouping, split a multiline string into list of lines:
#    .strip().splitlines(): strip leading and trailing spaces
#    if l.strip(): remove empty inner lines
# 2. groupby() groups consecutive lines based on matched/unmatched such that:
#    [[True , [list of consecutive   matched lines]],
#     [False. [list of consecutive unmatched lines]],
#           ...
#     [True , [list of consecutive   matched lines]],
#     [False, [list of consecutive unmatched lines]]]
# 3. Iterate thru elem yielded by groupby()
# 4. If matched (e.g. elem[0]==True): use only the 1st matched line, split at the
#    1st space, then yield as a list ['header_prefix', 'remainder of 1st matched line']
# 5. If not matched (e.g. elem[0]==False):
#    a. Split each unmatched lines at the 1st space to produce a list-of-lists
#       l2 = [['Interface:', 'en0'], ['Interface:', 'anpi0'], ['Interface:', 'awdl0']]
#    b. Assuming the 1st element of each inner list are the same, so use l2[0][0]
#    c. And compose a list of all 2nd elements of the inner list => ['en0', 'anpi0', 'awdl0']
#    d. Yield a list from b and c: ['Interface:', ['en0', 'anpi0', 'awdl0']]
