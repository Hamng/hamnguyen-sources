Problem:
Hi all, I have a command line tool that outputs a multi-line string
and Iâ€™d like to parse it into a dict. Anyone have a nice way of doing so?
Input to parse:
Node: HomePod (2).local.
    Interface: en0
    Interface: awdl0
Node: HomePod.local.
    Interface: en0
    Interface: anpi0
    Interface: awdl0
    Interface: lo0
Output:
[{"node": "HomePod (2).local.", "Interfaces": ["en0", "awdl0"]},
 {"node": "HomePod.local.", "Interfaces": ["en0", "anpi0", "awdl0", "lo0"]}]

from typing import List, Dict
import itertools

#
# 1. Before grouping, split a multiline string into list of lines:
#    .strip().splitlines(): strip leading and trailing spaces
#    if l.strip(): remove empty inner lines
#    l.strip().split(' ', 1): split at the 1st space
#    lst = [['Node:', 'foo'], ['Intf:', 'bar1'], ['Intf:', 'bar2'], ...]
# 2. groupby() groups consecutive inner lists based on the 1st elem of each inner list:
#    [['Node:'     , [list of consecutive inner lists whose 1st element is 'Node:'     ]],
#     ['Interface:', [list of consecutive inner lists whose 1st element is 'Interface:']],
#           ...
#     ['Node:'     , [list of consecutive inner lists whose 1st element is 'Node:'     ]],
#     ['Interface:', [list of consecutive inner lists whose 1st element is 'Interface:']]]
# 3. Iterate thru the elements yielded by groupby()
# 4. If the 1st element (k) matches; i.e. k == header_prefix:
#    a. next(grp): use only the 1st of the inner lists
#    b. next(grp)[1]: and only the 2nd element of that inner list.
#    c. Form a new dct from k, and 4b => dct = {'node': 'HomePod.local.'}
# 5. Else, if not matched:
#    a. For all inner lists (in grp)
#    b. (Assuming the 1st elements are all the same,)
#       Form a list of all 2nd elements => ['en0', 'anpi0', 'awdl0', 'lo0']
#    c. Update dct with a dict entry formed by k, and 5b
#    d. Yield dct: {'node': 'HomePod.local.', 'interfaces': ['en0', 'anpi0', 'awdl0', 'lo0']}
# 6. Caveat: header lines (at the end) NOT followed by body lines will be ignored.
