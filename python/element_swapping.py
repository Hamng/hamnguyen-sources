Facebook Coding Practice: [Strings] Element Swapping
Given a sequence of n integers arr, determine the lexicographically smallest sequence which may be obtained from it after performing at most k element swaps, each involving a pair of consecutive elements in the sequence.
Note: A list x is lexicographically smaller than a different equal-length list y if and only if, for the earliest index at which the two lists differ, x's element at that index is smaller than y's element at that index.
Signature
int[] findMinArray(int[] arr, int k)
Input
n is in the range [1, 1000].
Each element of arr is in the range [1, 1,000,000].
k is in the range [1, 1000].
Output
Return an array of n integers output, the lexicographically smallest sequence achievable after at most k swaps.
Example 1
n = 3
k = 2
arr = [5, 3, 1]
output = [1, 5, 3]
We can swap the 2nd and 3rd elements, followed by the 1st and 2nd elements, to end up with the sequence [1, 5, 3]. This is the lexicographically smallest sequence achievable after at most 2 swaps.
Example 2
n = 5
k = 3
arr = [8, 9, 11, 2, 1]
output = [2, 8, 9, 11, 1]
We can swap [11, 2], followed by [9, 2], then [8, 2].
