Facebook Coding Exercises: [Sorting] Counting Triangles

Given a list of N triangles with integer side lengths, determine how many different triangles there are. Two triangles are considered to be the same if they can both be placed on the plane such that their vertices occupy exactly the same three points.
Signature
int countDistinctTriangles(ArrayList<Sides> arr)
or
int countDistinctTrianges(int[][] arr)
Input
In some languages, arr is an Nx3 array where arr[i] is a length-3 array that contains the side lengths of the ith triangle. In other languages, arr is a list of structs/objects that each represent a single triangle with side lengths a, b, and c.
It's guaranteed that all triplets of side lengths represent real triangles.
All side lengths are in the range [1, 1,000,000,000]
1 <= N <= 1,000,000
Output
Return the number of distinct triangles in the list.
Example 1
arr = [[2, 2, 3], [3, 2, 2], [2, 5, 6]]
output = 2
The first two triangles are the same, so there are only 2 distinct triangles.
Example 2
arr = [[8, 4, 6], [100, 101, 102], [84, 93, 173]]
output = 3
All of these triangles are distinct.
Example 3
arr = [[5, 8, 9], [5, 9, 8], [9, 5, 8], [9, 8, 5], [8, 9, 5], [8, 5, 9]]
output = 1
All of these triangles are the same.

Algorithm:
    To test if triangles A and B are the same or not, sort their sides,
    then see if all sides match.

"""

#import math
# Add any extra import statements you may need here


# Add any helper functions you may need here


def countDistinctTriangles(arr):
  # The inner list comprehension sorts each member/triangle of arr[]
  # Then the outer list comprehension appends a triangle to distinct[]
  # if not already there.
  # Or better yet, build a set comprehension of the sorted triangles,
  # which eliminates duplications, then return the length of the set.
  # HINT: to be in a set, each member must be "hashable", or NOT-modifiable.
  # sorted(a) returns a list which is modifiable so unhashable!
  # Hence must cast each to a tuple() which is non-modifiable hence hashable.
  #distinct = list()
  #[distinct.append(d) for d in [sorted(a) for a in arr] if d not in distinct]
  #return len(distinct)
  return len({tuple(sorted(a)) for a in arr})












# These are the tests we use to determine if the solution is correct.
# You can add your own at the bottom, but they are otherwise not editable!
